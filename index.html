            <p>The world of everybody (all-at-once) must get out of the position of passively accepting guidance and
                receiving calls to virtue. The world of everybody (all-at-once) must accept the necessary position of
                taking
                control of the world-situation. That is what must happen—or else there can no longer be any hope of a
                cooperative world at peace.</p>
